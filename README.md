# MIA
This repository is a recreation of the MIA project found here: https://github.com/torodean/Antonius-MIA

MIA (Multiple Integrated Applications) is a program where I can store useful coding functions and apps I've created in one place for easy accessibility.

For a list of commands and features see the MIA manual found in the docs folder: https://github.com/torodean/MIA/docs/
