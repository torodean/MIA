# MIA
This repository is a recreation of the MIA project found here: https://github.com/torodean/Antonius-MIA

MIA (Multiple Integrated Applications) is a program where I can store useful coding functions and apps I've created in one place for easy accessibility.

For a list of commands and features see the MIA manual found in the docs folder: https://github.com/torodean/MIA/docs/

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several top-level directories to separate source code, documentation, and support files.

### `bin/`
Contains the source code for all integrated applications and utilities. This includes core modules, libraries, and executable logic organized by purpose and functionality.

### `docs/`
Contains the documentation for the project, including the MIA manual, usage instructions, design notes, and module-specific references.

### `build/` (if applicable)
Used for build artifacts, scripts, or platform-specific build outputs. This folder may be generated during the build process and is not typically version-controlled.

---

Additional directories may be added as the project evolves to support new tools, modules, or documentation needs.
