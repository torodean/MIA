# MIA
This repository is a recreation of the MIA project found here: https://github.com/torodean/Antonius-MIA

MIA (Multiple Integrated Applications) is a program where I can store useful coding functions and apps I've created in one place for easy accessibility.

For a list of commands and features see the MIA manual found in the docs folder: [https://github.com/torodean/MIA/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/torodean/MIA/tree/main/docs)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several top-level directories to separate source code, documentation, and support files.

### `bin/`
Contains the source code for all integrated applications and utilities. This includes core modules, libraries, and executable logic organized by purpose and functionality.

### `docs/`
Contains the documentation for the project, including the MIA manual, usage instructions, design notes, and module-specific references.

### `scripts/`
Used for storing various helper scripts to perform tasks. This includes various tasks related to installing files, building files, and more.

### `build/` (if applicable)
Used for build artifacts, scripts, or platform-specific build outputs. This folder may be generated during the build process and is not typically version-controlled.

### `release/` (if applicable)
This folder contains (when built) the executables and configuration files built for either combining into a release package or to be used standalone from the folder.

### `resources/` 
This folder contains resources and configuration files used by the MIA applications and tools.

Additional directories may be added as the project evolves to support new tools, modules, or documentation needs.

## Purpose and Scope 

MIA is a personal hobby project built primarily for experimentation, learning, and utility (primarily utilities which I need for whatever other projects I am working on at the time). It’s not intended for production use, and as such, parts of the codebase may be rough, inconsistent, or incomplete. This is due to some elements being very old, outdated, or other reasons. At the same time, I’ve made an effort to keep things reasonably clean and well-documented—especially to showcase my general approach to design and structure. This is ultimately a sandbox. The goal isn’t perfection, but exploration. MIA also doubles as a portfolio piece, offering a brief view into how I think about code, tools, documentation, designs and systems in a more relaxed, informal setting.
