# apps Directory Overview

This directory contains the standalone apps for the MIA project. Below is a brief description of each subfolder:
  
- **template/**  
  Contains a fully functional app featuring most of the basic application framework techniques used in developing MIA apps. This is used to both test new features and provide a common template for storing correct usage of the various features.

- **mia_original/**  
  This app contains many of the random features from the original MIA project that don't exist in other apps (before it was moved to an app-based system). Still in dev.

- **MIASequencer/**  
  the MIASequencer loads various defined 'sequences', which are combinations of various 'actions' (such as pressing characters, waiting, clicking the mouse, etc) and then performs those (or a subset of those) sequences.

- **old_game_tools/**  
  This folder contains some old game tools from the original MIA program. This includes a functioning WoWFishbot and some other WoW features.

- **workout/**  
  This contains workout generation tools which were contained in the original MIA project.
