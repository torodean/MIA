# Utilities - System

This folder contains system-related utility functions designed to support common system-level operations across applications.

## Timing

The `Timing.hpp` and `Timing.cpp` files provide a set of cross-platform utilities related to time management and thread pausing. The module is designed to offer precise control over execution delays and timing operations, and is intended to be expanded with additional time-related functions as needed. These functions use C++ standard library threading and chrono utilities to ensure consistent behavior on Windows and Linux platforms.
