# Utilities - Types

This folder contains utility functions related to type and data parsing, primarily focused on string manipulation and lightweight data formatting operations.

## StringUtils

The `StringUtils.hpp` and `StringUtils.cpp` files provide a collection of general-purpose, stateless string processing functions. These include common operations such as character removal, delimiter-based parsing, substring extraction, case conversion, validation of input formats, and basic string transformation. These utilities are designed to assist with simple parsing logic, text formatting, and value interpretation across various modules of the application. They are implemented with minimal dependencies and can be used wherever lightweight string handling is required.

This module is intended to be extended with additional type-related utilities or format-parsing helpers as needed.
