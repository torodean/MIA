# Program

This folder contains core program components, including error handling and related descriptions, which form the foundation for application functionality.

## Error Handling

The `Error.hpp` and `Error.cpp` files implement the `Error` class responsible for managing error codes and reporting within the application. This module centralizes error handling logic to ensure consistent error reporting and management.

## Error Descriptions

The `ErrorDescriptions.hpp` and `ErrorDescriptions.cpp` files store mappings of error codes to human-readable descriptions. This separation allows easy maintenance and extension of error messages without modifying core error handling logic.

---

This module is designed to be extended with additional program components and core functionalities as the application grows.
