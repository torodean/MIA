 * Description:
 *     This file provides the implementation of shared functionality for the
 *     AbstractMarkovModel class template, as defined in AbstractMarkovModel.hpp.
 *
 *     Specifically, it includes the concrete logic for training a Markov model
 *     using input sequences to populate a probability transition matrix. This
 *     logic is shared across all derived models and centralizes the core model
 *     building process.
 *
 *     This separation allows model implementations to focus on specialized
 *     behavior such as state sampling or custom input/output, while leveraging
 *     consistent training logic defined here.
