\section{Introduction}
This RPG system is an attempt to create a comprehensive RPG system to be used by an MMORPG. This system is inspired by the classic World Of Warcraft (WoW) game. It attempts to take elements which made the original WoW game great, and incorporate them. It also attempts to take elements of the newer versions of the game which are bad, and remedy them in a way that preserves the essence of what made the original versions of WoW good. This chapter will outline many of the features which may or may not be directly developed in this RPG system, but are kepy in mind during development.








\section{Power Progression}

One of the fundamental goals of this RPG system is to ensure that character progression feels meaningful at every stage of the game. In contrast to modern World of Warcraft (WoW), where leveling often results in a temporary weakening of the character relative to the world until max level is reached and gear progression begins, this system adopts a more linear and intuitive approach.

Inspired by classic WoW, every improvement, whether it be a new ability, a talent point, a stat increase, or a piece of gear, represents a true and permanent gain in power. The world scales around the player in a fixed manner, and character growth is never undone or diminished by artificial re-scaling or squish mechanics. This means that as players invest time into their characters, they will feel steadily more capable and powerful, with no regression or power dilution.

This model emphasizes consistent and rewarding progression, preserving the classic RPG ideal that advancement, whether through experience, training, or equipment, should always be a step forward.






\section{Expansions}

A core design philosophy of this system is that expansions should truly expand existing game systems, not replace or invalidate them. In many modern MMORPGs, and particularly in the evolution of World of Warcraft, expansions frequently override previous mechanics, render earlier content obsolete, and disrupt continuity in gameplay.

This RPG system is designed to avoid that failure. Expansions will be additive in nature, introducing new content, systems, and progression paths while preserving and reinforcing what already exists. All previously developed mechanics, zones, professions, gear, and abilities will remain accessible and relevant.

New content introduced through expansions will build upon the established foundation. Rather than forcing players to abandon past achievements or systems, expansions will increase the breadth and depth of the game world. The goal is to maintain a persistent, interconnected world where every stage of progression remains meaningful, regardless of when it was introduced.








\section{Crafting System}

Crafting is a foundational element of this RPG system, designed to be meaningful, rewarding, and relevant throughout a character's entire journey. Unlike in many modern MMORPGs, where crafting is often relegated to endgame utility and reduced to a passive grind, this system treats crafting as an integral path of character development and player interaction.

Professions and tools will play an active role in gameplay. Every profession will provide distinct value, with deliberate overlap to ensure no profession becomes obsolete or isolated. Players will be able to specialize in meaningful ways, and crafting will support both combat and non-combat roles. Whether creating gear, consumables, materials, or tools, crafted items will remain viable and useful across all levels of play.

As characters grow in power, so too will their crafting abilities. Crafting will not be an afterthought or a side activity to be rushed at max level, but a progression path that naturally evolves alongside combat and exploration. This system encourages economic interdependence, where players benefit from trading, collaboration, and the diverse outputs of various professions. Crafting is not just a system, it is a core part of the game's identity, enabling players to shape the world, their characters, and their community through meaningful, consistent engagement.










\section{Character Progression and Identity}

In this system, character growth is driven by player agency and in-world interaction, not by automated progression or rigid class templates. Unlike modern World of Warcraft, where spells and abilities are granted automatically with level-ups and class choice is fixed at character creation, this system offers a dynamic model of progression that reflects the player's actions and choices.

There are no predefined classes. Instead, characters develop identities through the paths they follow. The spells, abilities, and skills a character learns are determined by where they go, who they interact with, what they study, and how they spend their time. Progression is earned, not given. The more a character practices a skill, the more proficient they become. The more they explore a discipline, the more it unfolds for them.

This design gives players full control over how their characters evolve. A single character might grow into a warrior through constant combat, a spellcaster through arcane study, or something in between based on a unique combination of choices. Identities are shaped organically, not selected from a list.

This approach ensures that every character reflects the time, effort, and decisions of the player. Progression feels meaningful because it is the direct result of engagement with the world, not the product of a scripted leveling sequence.











\section{Gear and Itemization}

Gear in this system is a reflection of a character's journey, effort, and choices, not something handed out freely. Modern World of Warcraft has diluted the meaning of gear progression, making high-end items easily accessible and stripping rarity of its impact. This system returns to a model where gear is meaningful, and where rarity is not just a label, but an indicator of value, effort, and identity.

Items will exist across familiar rarity tiers, but those tiers will be tied directly to difficulty, effort, and sometimes chance. Rare and powerful items will be earned through difficult encounters, persistent exploration, or unique discoveries. They will not be guaranteed, and not every player will possess them. This ensures that standout gear remains exactly that - standout.

The average player's gear will reflect their chosen activities and investment. A player who explores dangerous ruins, masters a crafting discipline, or builds a network of allies will be rewarded with different gear outcomes than one who focuses solely on combat or trade. This makes gear a narrative and mechanical extension of the character, not just a stat stick.

With this approach, seeing a player wearing a particular item will tell a story. It restores a sense of achievement, recognition, and individuality that modern systems have largely discarded in the name of accessibility.







\section{Stat System and Character Customization}

The stat system in this RPG is a central element of player-driven character development. Unlike modern World of Warcraft, where stats are tied almost entirely to item level and increase passively with gear upgrades, this system makes stats an intentional and impactful part of character identity.

Players will select and develop their stats as they see fit. Every stat influences gameplay in a specific and tangible way, whether it's casting speed, damage output, movement precision, or defensive efficiency. These choices affect how a character functions in combat, exploration, and other systems. Growth is directed by the player, not dictated by external scaling.

There are no predefined builds or limitations on how stats must be arranged. Characters can develop along conventional paths or explore creative combinations to support unique playstyles. This freedom allows for a wide range of viable builds, each shaped by the player's decisions and goals.

In this system, stats are not trivial background numbers. They are a reflection of how the character has grown, what the player values, and how they choose to engage with the game world. This makes character progression both meaningful and personal.







\section{Pace and the Journey}

This RPG system is built around the idea that the journey is not a barrier to the game, it is the game. Unlike modern World of Warcraft, where the focus is on reaching max level as quickly as possible so that the "real" content can begin, this system places value on every step of a character's progression.

The pace is deliberately designed to be slow and immersive. It is intended to give players time to explore, interact, learn, and grow. Whether a player is casual or dedicated, the experience offers meaningful engagement throughout. Leveling is not something to rush through or skip; it provides purpose, discovery, and connection.

There is always something to do and someone to meet. Progression systems, crafting, exploration, and community interaction are all tightly woven into the leveling process. This encourages natural cooperation and social bonds, making the world feel alive and connected.

By avoiding artificial urgency and grind-focused design, the game fosters a space where players can enjoy the world for what it is, and not just as a means to an end. The result is a game that rewards attention, effort, and presence, not just speed.
